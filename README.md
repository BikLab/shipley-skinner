# Shipley-skinner Repository

This repository contains all raw files used in the study of soil microbial (16S rRNA) and eukaryotic (18S rRNA) communities at the Shipley-Skinner Reserve. Additionally, information regarding nematode-associated microbiome is also include in the 16S rRNA dataset.

  ## 16S rRNA (ASV table, taxonomy table, and metadata)
  
  soil microbial communities
  
  nematode-associated microbiome

  ## 18S rRNA (ASV table, taxonomy table, and metadata)
  
  soil eukaryotic communities 

Additionally, the repository contains the scripts used during data analysis as well as figures and tables (including supplementary) include the manuscript
